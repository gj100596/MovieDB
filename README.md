# MovieDB

The project is a part of the curriculum for the subject CS 744. Here we have a Server who has details of few movies stored in MySQL DB and its posters stored on File System. The Client can ask for details of any movie.

The project was in 3 phase:

1. Building System.
2. Building Load Generator and Testing.
3. Optimizing System.
